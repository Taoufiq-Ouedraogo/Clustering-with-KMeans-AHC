# Clustering with KMeans & AHC

## Description

This project explores the use of clustering algorithms, specifically **K-Means** and **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)**, to analyze and group datasets based on their characteristics.

The goal is to demonstrate how these techniques can be effectively applied in various contexts, such as:

- **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying customer groups based on common criteria for targeted marketing strategies.
- **Driver Clustering**: Analyzing driver behaviors for use cases related to speed and distance.


## Contents

- **`Customer-Clustering-with-KMeans-AHC.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook dedicated to customer segmentation using K-Means and AHC algorithms.
- **`Driver-Clustering-with-KMeans.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook exploring driver clustering using the K-Means algorithm.
- **`data/`**: Contains the datasets used for analysis.


## Objectives

- Understand and apply the fundamental principles of clustering.
- Compare the performance and visualizations of K-Means and AHC algorithms.
- Provide concrete and reproducible examples for real-world scenarios.
